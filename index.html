      <h3> Iris  </h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/astennent/iris">GitHub</a> | <a href="web-build.html">Web Demo</a> | <a href="IrisBuild.zip">Windows App</a> 
      <p> Iris is a program written in the Unity game engine which is used for relational data visualization. Once imported into the program, this data can be navigated in 3D. It's the largest project I've ever worked on and it will probably never be completely finished. My long term goal is for it to be useful in the context of data oriented research, competing, complementing, and/or integrating with tools like <a href="www.stata.com">Stata</a> and <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">MatLab</a>. </p>
      <p> Unfortunately, Unity's plugin will not work in Chrome 45+ because Google is phasing out NPAPI plugins. For justification see <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation">this explanation</a>. Unity is working on a WebGL export option, but it is currently in Beta (as of May 2015). If you're running Windows, I recommend downloading the Windows App as it runs much more quickly and can go full screen.</p>

      <h3> Flood </h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/astennent/Flood">GitHub</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Atennent.Flood">Android Marketplace</a>
      <p> This is a clone of an old puzzle game. Basically the goal is to "flood" a board of multi-colored tiles by clicking colored buttons and slowly absorbing tiles, starting from the top left of the board. Tiles that are on the border of your flooded section are absorbed if they match the color you click. My version keeps track of high scores and has a couple hundred levels to choose from, as well as a Zen mode where the boards are randomly generated. </p>

      <h3> 2048 Island </h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/astennent/2048">GitHub</a> | <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=m.Company.Twenty4848">Android Marketplace</a>
      <p> This is 2048 clone for Android that I made back when it was cool. This one is completely over-engineered for what is supposed to be a simple game, but looks <strong> really </strong> good. Animated tiles, swooping cameras, a pointless island theme, timed mode. None of it really adds much to the game, except for a new game mode I came up with where you have 4 small boards that are played separately and instead of losing when the board has no moves left, it just freezes for a couple turns and comes back with a higher score multiplier. Eventually, the game ends when all 4 boards are frozen at once. </p>

      <h3> Social Experiment </h3>
      <a href="http://lindsayhundley.com"> Link </a> | <a href="http://euroakadeemia.ee/materjalid/fearon.pdf"> Paper </a>
      <p> My girlfriend is a graduate student at Stanford University studying Political Science. For her field paper, I created an online interface for an experiment that she designed to test James Fearon's theory that a long shadow of the future increases bargaining delay. If you're interested in more details, read the paper: <a href="http://euroakadeemia.ee/materjalid/fearon.pdf"> Fearon (1998)</a>. The website is hosted on an EC2 instance and written with the Django web framework with a postgres database backend. Note that you actually need credentials to enter, but look at the quality of that login page! </p>

      <h3> TA website </h3>
      <a href="http://ta.lindsayhundley.com"> Link </a>
      <p> In addition to setting up the website for her experiment, I also made my girlfriend a static TA website. It's running on Amazon S3, just like this one.

      <h3> Bubbleshooter </h3>
      <a class="TODO" href=""> Github </a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pckc4SZgat4"> Demo </a>
      <p> When I was a freshman at William & Mary, there were a couple people on my hall that played the facebook game "Bubble Shooter" which is an old arcade game where you have a cannon at the bottom of the screen and you angle it to shoot and knockdown colored balls. I was bad at the game, so I wrote a program that took a screenshot of the game, calculated the optimal shot position, and clicked the mouse in a loop until the game was complete. They said it was cheating. I say it was resourceful.

      <h2> About </h2>

      <h3> I like talking about myself... </h3>
      <p> Particularly things related to programming. Most of my spare time is spent working on side projects,  thinking about future projects, or helping other people with computer problems. I currently work in San Francisco as an engineer at <a href="www.factset.com">FactSet</a>, a financial software company. Before that I did internships at Amazon and William & Mary, where I went to college. </p>

      <h3> I also like other stuff... </h3>
      <p> My hobbies include Chipotle, long walks on the beach, and thinking about other things to add to this list.</p>

      <h3> Most of all, I like you! </h3>
